## Test Concept: Security System Testing

**1. Test Objective:**

The objective of this testing is to verify the functionality and performance of the security system to ensure it meets the specified requirements.

**2. Test Scope:**

The testing will cover the following aspects of the security system:
- Activation and deactivation of the system
- Alarm triggering and response
- Password input and verification
- Sensor readings and detection
- LED and sound indications
- User interaction with buttons

**3. Test Environment:**

- Particle Photon Inventor's Kit Hardware
- Emulated or physical environment simulating home security setup
- Test environment should allow for the simulation of various scenarios, such as door opening, button presses, and sensor triggers.

**4. Test Cases:**

### Test Case 1: System Activation
- Description: Verify that the system activates correctly when the activation button is pressed.
- Precondition: The system is idle.
- Steps:
  1. Press the activation button.
- Expected Result: The system enters the activated state, and a short tone is heard.

### Test Case 2: Door Open Detection
- Description: Verify that the system detects door opening and responds accordingly.
- Precondition: The system is in the activated state.
- Steps:
  1. Simulate the door opening.
- Expected Result:
  - The yellow LED lights up.
  - A tone is heard for 30 seconds.
  - The system enters the password loop state.

### Test Case 3: Password Input and Verification
- Description: Verify that the system accepts the correct password input and responds accordingly.
- Precondition: The system is in the password loop state.
- Steps:
  1. Enter the correct password by pressing the buttons as specified.
- Expected Result:
  - The yellow LED turns off.
  - The green LED lights up.
  - Two short tones are heard.
  - The system returns to the idle state.

### Test Case 4: Incorrect Password Input
- Description: Verify that the system handles incorrect password input correctly.
- Precondition: The system is in the password loop state.
- Steps:
  1. Enter an incorrect password by pressing the buttons in the wrong order or with wrong timing.
- Expected Result:
  - The yellow LED blinks briefly.
  - The system continues to the alarm state.
  - The red LED lights up.

### Test Case 5: Alarm State Reset
- Description: Verify that the system resets the alarm state when the correct buttons are pressed.
- Precondition: The system is in the alarm state.
- Steps:
  1. Simulate pressing the correct buttons within the specified time frame.
- Expected Result:
  - The alarm state is reset.
  - The system returns to the idle state.

**5. Test Execution:**

- Perform the test cases according to the defined steps and expected results.
- Record the actual results and any deviations or issues encountered.
- If automated testing is possible, use appropriate tools or scripts to execute the test cases.

**6. Test Reporting:**

- Document the test results, including any deviations or issues found during testing.
- Provide a summary of the overall system performance and compliance with requirements.
- Include recommendations for improvements or further testing, if applicable.

Note: The test cases provided are just examples and should be tailored to the specific requirements and implementation of the security system being tested.
